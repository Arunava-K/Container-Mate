## Key Features

- Deploy applications to a Portainer server through Discord commands.
- Retrieve the URL of a deployed application using the Portainer API.
- Easy setup and configuration.
- Customizable and extendable bot commands.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/portabot.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install discord requests
   ```

3. Update the following placeholders in the script:

   - `your-discord-bot-token` - Replace with your Discord bot token.
   - `your-portainer-server-api-url` - Replace with the URL of your Portainer server's API.
   - `your-portainer-api-token` - Replace with the token generated from the Portainer server.

4. Run the bot:

   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```

5. Invite the bot to your Discord server. Refer to the official Discord documentation on how to create and invite a bot.

## Usage

Once the bot is running and connected to your Discord server, you can use the following command to deploy an application:

```
!deploy app-name
```

Replace `app-name` with the name of the application you want to deploy. The bot will use the Portainer API to deploy the application and return the URL to access it.

## Commands

- `!deploy app-name` - Deploy an application to the Portainer server and return the URL to access it.
- Add your own custom commands by extending the bot script.

In this example, I have combined the HTML and Markdown stylizations into a single README.md file. The content structure and information remain the same as the previous example, but the HTML tags have been replaced with Markdown syntax where applicable.

Remember to replace the placeholders (`your-username`, `bot_logo.png`, `screenshot.png`, `your-discord-bot-token`, `your-portainer-server-api-url`, and `your-portainer-api-token`) with the appropriate information and assets for your project.

Feel free to further customize and enhance this single-file README.md based on your project's specific requirements and design preferences.
